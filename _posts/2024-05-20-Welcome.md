**Hello and welcome to my blog!**

This is my first attempt and creating my a blog. My intent here is to have a place where I can post writeups from Hack The Box boxes that I've completed, CTF's that I've competed in, explanations for code that I've writen, and general INFOSEC and Cybersecurity related information that I find interesting and want to share with the world. I have found a vast majority of writups for HTB boxes to leave me wanting more, and it almost seems like a lot of them are writeups, of writeups, and lack the ability to propely explain their thought process, and reasoning behind using certain tools and methodoligies. I want to do more than that, and make this blog a learning experience not only for myself, but for others. As the blog gets more filled out, you'll be able to search for writups, look for different posts based off tags, and search through categories such as *Competitive CTF's* and *Hack The Box*. I plan on having some writups posted on here soon, and hope that you'll enjoy!
