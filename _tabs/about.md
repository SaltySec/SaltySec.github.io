![About](assets/img/About/image.png)

I'm Salty, an ``INFOSEC``, ``hacking``, and ``cybersecurity`` enthusiast from the US. I've been passionate about cybersecurity since March 2022. While I still have much to learn, I'm excited about the journey ahead. I've competed in several CTFs and regularly participate in Hack the Box competitions. I am actively pursuing a career in INFOSEC.

Although I don't come from an IT background, balancing my blue-collar job, studying for cybersecurity certifications, and enjoying my newfound hobby has been challenging yet rewarding. I believe my non-IT background gives me a unique perspective, often allowing me to approach problems differently from my peers. This unconventional viewpoint has proven to be both an advantage and a challenge, but more often than not, it works in my favor.

In the future, I hope this blog will be filled with various content, including ``malware analysis reports``, ``Hack the Box write-ups``, ``code explanations``, and ``CTF write-ups``. Check back regularly to see my latest updatesâ€”hopefully, you'll learn a few things along the way too! Thank you for visiting.
